The Automated Surgical Risk Calculator for Mortality Innovation is a project to develop a tool from CPRS through the “Tools” drop down that will auto-fill pertinent information into the developed risk calculator. The Automated Risk Calculator will utilize the generated data and allow for the user to manually input required information to support clinical decision-making regarding perioperative risk. The tool will then allow for information to be written back to the patients file in CPRS. In addition, a secondary tool will be created to store and develop a repository for research of risk calculations developed.
